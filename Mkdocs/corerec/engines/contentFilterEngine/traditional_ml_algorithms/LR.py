LR.py

This module implements the Logistic Regression algorithm, a popular supervised learning method used for binary classification tasks. Logistic Regression is a linear model that estimates the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor variables.

Usage:
    To use this module, import the `LR` class and instantiate it with the desired parameters. Then, fit the model to your training data and use it to make predictions on new data.

    Example:
        from engines.contentFilterEngine.traditional_ml_algorithms.LR import LR
        model = LR()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)

Note:
    - Ensure that your data is preprocessed appropriately before fitting the model, as Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the log-odds of the response.
    - This implementation may require additional libraries such as NumPy or SciPy for matrix operations.
