tfidf.py

This module is intended to implement the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm, a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.

Usage:
    Import the `TFIDF` class, fit it to your corpus, and transform your documents into TF-IDF vectors.

    Example:
        from engines.contentFilterEngine.traditional_ml_algorithms.tfidf import TFIDF
        vectorizer = TFIDF()
        vectorizer.fit(corpus)
        tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.transform(documents)

Note:
    - This file currently contains a placeholder and requires a full implementation of the TF-IDF algorithm.
    - TF-IDF is commonly used in text mining and information retrieval applications.
