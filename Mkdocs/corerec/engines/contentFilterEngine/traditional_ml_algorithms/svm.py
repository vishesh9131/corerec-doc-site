svm.py

This module provides a basic implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which is used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces and are versatile due to the use of different kernel functions.

Usage:
    Import the `SVM` class and create an instance with the desired kernel and parameters. Fit the model to your data and use it for predictions.

    Example:
        from engines.contentFilterEngine.traditional_ml_algorithms.svm import SVM
        model = SVM(kernel='linear')
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)

Note:
    - The current implementation is a placeholder and needs to be completed with actual SVM logic.
    - Consider using libraries like scikit-learn for a more comprehensive SVM implementation.
