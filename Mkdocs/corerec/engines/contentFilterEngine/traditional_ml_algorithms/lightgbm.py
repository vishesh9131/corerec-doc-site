lightgbm.py

This module is intended to implement the LightGBM algorithm, a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It is designed for distributed and efficient training of large datasets.

Usage:
    Import the `LIGHTGBM` class and configure it with the necessary parameters. Train the model on your dataset and use it for predictions.

    Example:
        from engines.contentFilterEngine.traditional_ml_algorithms.lightgbm import LIGHTGBM
        model = LIGHTGBM()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)

Note:
    - This file currently contains a placeholder and requires a full implementation of the LightGBM algorithm.
    - LightGBM is particularly useful for large datasets and can handle categorical features directly.
