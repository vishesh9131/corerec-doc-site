vw.py

This module is intended to implement the Vowpal Wabbit (VW) algorithm, a fast and scalable machine learning system that supports online learning and large-scale data.

Usage:
    Import the `VW` class, configure it with the necessary parameters, and fit it to your data. Use the trained model for predictions.

    Example:
        from engines.contentFilterEngine.traditional_ml_algorithms.vw import VW
        model = VW()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)

Note:
    - The current implementation is a placeholder and needs to be completed with actual Vowpal Wabbit logic.
    - Vowpal Wabbit is particularly useful for large datasets and online learning scenarios.
