    Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation Base Class

    Implementation of the SASRec (Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation) architecture.
    Combines sequential modeling with self-attention mechanisms for capturing both
    long-term and short-term user preferences.

    Features:
        - Self-attention for sequential recommendation
        - Position embeddings
        - Bidirectional training
        - Layer normalization and dropout
        - Causal attention masking
